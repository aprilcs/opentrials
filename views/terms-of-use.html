  <p>

  <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>
    We collect information from reputable sources, but we make no promises
    about the completeness, timeliness, or accuracy of the information we store
    and display. For example, we:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Gather some data from historical sources, which may have gaps common to
        any historical record;
      </li>
      <li>
        May not be able to access all updates from the original sources, so a
        trial may be listed as ongoing after it has closed, or may not list all
        outcomes of the trial; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Gather information from formats that may not perfectly preserve the
        original information, such as databases that contain scans of PDFs.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p>

  <p>
    If you’re aware of such an issue, we invite you to <a
      href="/flag-error">submit corrections</a> to us! We will attempt to
    correct it when possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not endorse the scientific, clinical, or ethical aspects of the
    trials we publish.
  </p>
  <p>
    The information we publish is not a recommendation to use a particular
    medicine or participate in a particular trial. If you have questions
    about a particular treatment, please consult a healthcare professional.
